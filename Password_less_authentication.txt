Pssword-less Authenticaiton with 3 steps:

Create your environment first:
   1.Consider any no of servers(one is client/local server and remaing all are remote servers)
   2.Create same user(ex: sshuser) across all servers and provide password for each server.
   3.Make sure that Password Authentication yes on all servers in the file /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Password-less Authentication with 3 steps:
===============================================
   1. Goto sshuser using su sshuser on local host and generate ssh-keys using ssh-keygen command
   2. Then move to .ssh directory there you will find private and public keys. So move public key to remote servers using ssh-copy-id  <ip-address-of-remote-server1>
	(repeat above step for all remote servers from locahost)
   3. Now use ssh <user_name(in my case it is sshuser)>@ip_address_of_remote_server
      	it will connect to remote server without asking password
This is called passwordless authentiation between servers
